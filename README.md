## Module1 Challenge: Code Refactor

### Project Description

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. What I did in this project:
* Refactored source code to contain semantic HTML elements.
* Refactored the structure of HTML elements to make sure the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* Refactored image elements to make sure website accessibility.
* Refactored CSS to make sure no duplicate code.
* Added proper comments on CSS.
* Deployed application on live URL.
